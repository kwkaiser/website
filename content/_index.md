## Howdy

I'm Karl -- enthusiast for data science, software, bioinformatics, linux, and whatever else is drawing my attention this week. I made this site as a poster for some of my work and to write up my projects.

I've worked on all sorts of stuff, but a few of the hot button topics I have some experience with are:

- Standard full stack web dev stuff
- Database design & administration
- CRUD API development
- SPA development
- Natural language processing
- Deep learning with CNNs, RNNs & the like
- Evolutionary algorithms & simulation
- Developing & deploying distributed applications

I'm always happy to chat, so feel free to reach out with an email :)
