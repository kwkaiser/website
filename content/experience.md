#### Senior Software Engineer | [_Finch_](https://www.tryfinch.com/)

05/2022 - 04/2025

At Finch, I worked towards building a unified payroll API (think Plaid, for payroll). I focused much of my time on the backend around our jobs system responsible for reading and writing data from/to payroll providers; with a few key projects being:

- Migrating the job system from running alonside alongside our api to running jobs in containerized, ephemeral environments via AWS lambdas + ECS (helped improve system & integration stability)
- Migrating jobs from ECS to EKS (kubernetes migration, helped save costs by allowing variable job specs)
- Migrating jobs from EKS to [Temporal](https://temporal.io/)

I was heavily involved in several other systems-focused projects around scaling infra, improving observability, etc, as well as more product-facing workstreams such as the introduction of Finch's [deductions API](https://www.tryfinch.com/product/deductions).
